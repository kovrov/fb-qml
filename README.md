FB QML
======

To run this, original Flashback data files reqiured. At the moment
`fb-qml.conf` file have to be edited manualy. Set `datapath` value
in `General` section to absolute path for the data files. E.g.:

    [General]
    datapath=/home/user/MyDocs/FLASHDATA

Location and format of `.conf` file varies from platform to platform,
for Harmattan it is `/home/user/.config/inc11/fb-qml.conf`.
